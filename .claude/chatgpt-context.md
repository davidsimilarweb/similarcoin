Got it ✅ — let’s put this together into a clean hackathon-ready project summary for Similarcoin, inspired by BAT but centered on web/mobile panel data.

📊 Similarcoin – “The Token of Digital Attention Data”

🔹 Project Overview

Similarcoin is a crypto token (on Ethereum Layer 2 for scalability & low fees) that powers a data-for-rewards ecosystem.
	•	Users: install an Android/iOS app or browser extension that collects anonymous usage data (sites visited, app usage stats, privacy reports).
	•	Rewards: they earn Similarcoin for contributing data.
	•	Utilities: tokens can be used inside the ecosystem for:
	1.	Access to Insights & Reports → unlock traffic trends, competitor insights, or export datasets.
	2.	Prediction & Gamification → stake tokens to play “predict the next trending site/app” games.
	3.	Marketplace for Data → developers, marketers, or researchers pay in tokens to access aggregated, anonymized traffic datasets.

This creates a closed-loop economy where data = currency.

⸻

🔹 Why Layer 2?
	•	Low fees + fast transactions (crucial for micropayments).
	•	Better UX for earning/spending small amounts.
	•	Can bridge back to Ethereum mainnet if needed.
	•	Candidates: Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, zkSync.

🔹 Tokenomics (Draft v1)

🔸 Token Supply
	•	Fixed supply: e.g. 1 billion Similarcoin (SIM) minted.
	•	Deflationary mechanics possible (burn small % of marketplace fees).

🔸 Distribution
	1.	Users (60%)
	•	Earn by sharing panel data (via extension/app).
	•	Daily/monthly rewards → incentivize continued participation.
	2.	Data Buyers / Enterprises (20%)
	•	Incentives for early adoption (discounted tokens).
	•	Grants to startups integrating Similarcoin API.
	3.	Team + Development (10%)
	•	For hackathon devs + future roadmap.
	•	Vested linearly over time.
	4.	Community & Governance (10%)
	•	DAO treasury for future proposals.
	•	Prediction games, community rewards, ecosystem growth.

⸻

🔸 Token Flow
	•	Users earn SIM → from contributing data.
	•	Researchers/Marketers buy SIM (with USDC/ETH) → to unlock insights or API reports.
	•	Marketplace redistributes SIM → back to users (supply side).
	•	Gamification/Predictions add extra sinks → keeping demand high.

⸻

🔹 MVP Hackathon Scope
	•	Android app / extension (mock data collection): track usage / allow manual upload (esp. iOS privacy reports).
	•	Reward system: wallet integration on L2, users see SIM balance grow.
	•	Web dashboard:
	•	“Spend 5 SIM to unlock today’s top 10 trending sites/apps.”
	•	“Stake 10 SIM: predict if TikTok grows this week. Win pool if right.”
	•	Marketplace mock: allow “purchasing” a CSV dataset using SIM.

⸻

🔹 Future Vision
	•	Full data DAO → token holders govern what’s collected & shared.
	•	Integration with SEO / marketing SaaS tools.
	•	Cross-partner adoption → Similarcoin accepted by adtech, SEO, research platforms.

⸻

⚡ In short:
	•	BAT for traffic analytics.
	•	Users earn → by sharing data.
	•	Marketers pay → for insights.
	•	Layer 2 → makes it usable at scale.
	•	Closed-loop economy → ensures token has real utility.

👉 Do you want me to also sketch a token incentive model with concrete numbers (e.g., daily emission rates, how much a user might earn per week, and how marketplace pricing would work)? That would make the hackathon pitch more “real.”
